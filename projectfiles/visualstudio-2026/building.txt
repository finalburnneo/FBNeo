Exclude NASM version, please use visualstudio-2019

Pre-Building:

1) download and run visual studio 2026 IDE community edition installer from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ 
2) select Desktop development with C++
3) next you will need a perl interpreter for windows. I recommend ActivePerl (https://www.activestate.com/products/activeperl/downloads/). I usually use the oldest version available. Make sure that you have enabled the checkbox to add perl to the current path.
4) Then you need NASM for the assembly files. Go here: https://github.com/ShiftMediaProject/VSNASM. Simple configuration of NASM compilation environment.

Building
1) checkout the code using git (Optionally: fork it first!)
2) in the checked out code, open projectfiles then visualstudio-2026, then open fbneo_vs2026.sln
3) select the correctly platform and build type. 
4) hit build!
