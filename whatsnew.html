<h3>v0.2.97.12</h3>
<p><b>Note:</b> This version has some changes to the Megadrive driver. The driver is now based on the MESS software list.</p>
<p>The game shortnames are prepended by <i>md_</i> to differentiate them from the arcade games where conflicts occur. FB Alpha will look for your roms in the normal zip names, you do <b>not</b> need to create a new copy of the games and prepend <i>md_</i>. It is advisable to have the Megadrive roms in the seventh or eighth rom paths to avoid conflicts with arcade games. Support files will need to retain the <i>md_</i> in order to avoid conflicts, however.</p>
<p>All Megadrive games are now enabled (except for Virtua Racing because the SVP isn't emulated), most should work, however, some may not.</p>
<ul>
<li>Megadrive Changes
<ul>
<li>Updated Megadrive driver based on MESS 0.143u7 software list [Barry]</li>

<li>Increased the maximum number for sek handlers to 10 [Barry]</li>
<li>Added better SRAM support and support for custom mappers as per MESS [Barry]</li>
<li>Removed menu option for making a datfile with both arcade games and Megadrive games, the two would conflict, and arcade and Megadrive dats need to be handled seperately [Barry]</li>
<li>Updated the dat file creation module to remove the <i>md_</i> from the Megadrive shortnames [Barry]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Added clone of Aquajack to the Taito-Z driver [Barry]</li>

<h3>v0.2.97.06</h3>
<p>This version includes a big change in the Z80 CPU interface. Specifically MAME's Z80 core is now used for all games. This should give better results and make the program more portable. We have done a lot of testing but if you notice any new problems please let us know and we can fix them.</p>
<p>This version also includes changes in the EEPROM code and input assignment code. As well as the changed save states for the ZET interface, these render old config and save files pretty much useless. <b>It is advised to delete the contents of the <i>config\games</i> folder before using this version</b>. Savestates are a bit hit-and-miss at the moment anyway. I plan to pay some attention to savestates in the next version and hopefully boost compatibility.</p>

<div class="note">From this point forward, all releases are handled by Barry and each individual contribution is labelled.</div>

<h3>v0.2.96.92</h3>
<ul>
<li>CaptainCPS readded netplay and removed the dependancy on any external dlls - use them at your own risk</li>
<li>Fixed a problem with the SuperScale filter on nVidia gfx cards</li>
<li>Merged in CaptainCPS's improvements to the game selection dialog</li>
<li>Fixed a problem with the game information dialog displaying incorrect images</li>

<li>Added the 2xPM filter to the softfx filters with help from CaptainCPS</li>
<li>Added ElSemi's SuperScale and SuperScale75 filters</li>

<li>Added CaptainCPS's auto monitor aspect ratio code</li>
<li>Added driver for Unico games</li>

<h3>v0.2.96.90</h3>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>It works in much the same way as the UI localisation, beware though, that if you have a large file it can take some time to start the program, try and keep the file small and with only the titles you want to translate</li>
<li>Maximum titles to translate is currently set at 5000</li>
<li>The advantage of doing it this way is that the whole program benefits from translated titles, not just certain parts and the speed hit is only felt once rather than every time a title is retrieved</li>
<li>Obviously this only works with UNICODE build</li>
</ul></li>

<h3>v0.2.95.23</h3>

<ul>
<li>This is still an alpha release!</li>
<li>Note that, if compiled with GCC, you will need to use version 3.3.x, and the experimental DirectX 9 blitter is not built</li>
<li>Changed the way FB Alpha looks for ROMs. Now, it will always check the last path for any given .zip file, even when a .zip file of the same name is present in another path. This way, we can keep ROMs that are only needed for FB Alpha seperate without sacrifising compatibility with other emulators</li>
<li>Changed the way Neo Geo memory cards work, allowing the use of 1 megabit cards</li>
<li>Emulated protection in Super Sidekicks (was patched before)</li>
<li>Fixed the last few bad game names / bad ROM definitions</li>

<ul>
<li>This is still an alpha release!</li>
<li>Note that, if compiled with GCC, you will need to use version 3.3.x, and the experimental DirectX 9 blitter is not built</li>

<li>Fixed a few game names / bad ROM definitions</li>
<li>Fixed CPS1 games sound / crashing if started as the 1st game</li>

</ul>

<h3>v0.129</h3>
<ul>
<li>There's no need to use patched XOR's anymore! Armwar, Pgear &amp; Pgearr1 now use the original XOR tables released by Raz. A very big thankyou goes out to Raz &amp; FinalDave for helping me solve this problem :)</li>

<li>Re-ordered the games list. CPS-1/CPS-Changer games can now be found at the bottom of the game list, in alphabetical order</li>
<li>Forced "bReadInputEveryFrame" to default as "0" (off). According to Raz this should help with the netplay. The "bDrvSaveAll" option should also be set to "0" if you are using the netplay feature</li>
</ul>
