 *           4449233
 *
 * All patents give interpolation coefficients
 *  { 8, 8, 8, 4, 4, 2, 2, 1 }
 *  This sequence will not calculate the published
 *  fractions:
 * 1 8 0.125
 * 2 8 0.234
 * 3 8 0.330
 * 4 4 0.498
 * 5 4 0.623
 * 6 2 0.717
 * 7 2 0.859
 * 0 1 1.000
 *
 * Instead,  { 8, 8, 8, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1 }
 * will calculate those coefficients and this has been used below.
 * LN:
 * The real chip uses shifters and not true division to achieve those factors,
 * so they have been replaced by the shifting coefficients:
 * { 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0 }

 /* quick note on derivative analysis:
 Judging by all the TI chips I (Lord Nightmare) have done this test on, the first derivative between successive values of the LPC tables should follow a roughly triangular or sine shaped curve, the second derivative should start at a value, increase slightly, then decrease smoothly and become negative right around where the LPC curve passes 0, finally increase slightly right near the end. If it doesn't do this, there is probably a wrong value in there somewhere. The pitch and energy tables follow similar patterns but aren't the same since they never cross 0. The chirp table doesn't follow this pattern at all.

Note: The coefficients match those from the datasheet, and its addendum, with the exception of the energy table. The energy table on the datasheet (and in the QV5220.COD from qboxpro) lists it in RMS notation which doesn't help us since I(Lord Nightmare) can't figure out the proper formula TI used for converting energy to RMS (the obvious 'take all the values in the chirp ROM, multiply them by 1/2/3/4/etc, square each one, sum them up, divide by 51, which is # of ROM entries in chirp ROM, and take the square root of the result', doesn't QUITE work. It almost does, if you add 16 to the result, for the first 4 entries, but beyond that the entries become farther and farther offset).
Note that all the LPC K* values match the TMS5110a table exactly.

/* The following TMS5220C coefficients come from the tables in QBOXPRO, a program written at least in part by George "Larry" Brantingham of Quadravox, formerly of Texas Instruments, who had laid out the silicon for the TMS5100/TMC0280/CD2801. It is the same as the TMS5220 but has a change in the energy table (is this actually correct? or is this one correct for both 5220s? or is this the wrong table and the TMS5220 one correct for both?)
Note: the energy table in QV5220.COD is also in RMS and was not used (it also may well be incorrect; the values in QV5220.COD have an offset by one index which looks wrong), instead the table from the 5200/5220 is used here.
Note: the Kx tables are taken directly from QV5220.COD but with /64 added to each value as the values are stored ranging from -32768 to 32767 in QBOXPRO instead of -512 to 511 as on the real chip.
***These values have not yet been verified against a real TMS5220C, see below as for why***
This has not yet been verified against a real TMS5220C, and doing so will require decapping one as the TMS5220C, unlike the TMS5220, has a nonfunctional PROMOUT pin. This makes reading the internal LPC tables out electronically (via PROMOUT) impossible.
