You may freely use, modify, and distribute both the FB Alpha source code and binary, however the following restrictions apply to the FB Alpha original material (see below for a list of libraries with differing licenses, please consult their respective documentation for more information):

 - You may not sell, lease, rent or otherwise seek to gain monetary profit from FB Alpha;
 - You must make public any changes you make to the source code;
 - You must include, verbatim, the full text of this license;
 - You may not distribute binaries which support games with copyright dates less then three years old;

FB Alpha would not exist without a lot of code from the MAME project. The MAME project is subject to it's own license, which can be found at http://mamedev.org/legal.html. Due to the use of MAME code in FB Alpha, FB Alpha is also subject to the terms of the MAME license.

FB Alpha is based on Final Burn (formally at http://www.finalburn.com), see additional text below.
