You may freely use, modify, and distribute both the FB Neo source code and binary, however the following restrictions apply to the FB Neo original material (see below for a list of libraries with differing licenses, please consult their respective documentation for more information):

 - You may not sell, lease, rent or otherwise seek to gain monetary profit from FB Neo;
 - You must make public any changes you make to the source code;
 - You must include, verbatim, the full text of this license;
 - You may not distribute FB Neo with ROM images unless you have the legal right to distribute them;
 - You may not ask for donations to support your work on any project that uses the FB Neo source code.

FB Neo can currently be obtained from https://neo-source.com.

FB Neo would not exist without a lot of code from the MAME project. The MAME project is subject to its own license, which can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mamedev/mame/5cef4e1f91010f0d573bbd662208979fa39e73ec/docs/mamelicense.txt. Due to the use of MAME code in FB Neo, FB Neo is also subject to the terms of the MAME license.

FB Neo is based on Final Burn (formally at http://www.finalburn.com), see additional text below.
